1. Bag of Words model [tf-idf feature] </br>
    Random Forest, accuracy: 0.94609 </br>
    Naive Bayes + SGDClassifer, accuracy: 0.967 </br>
    </br>
2. Word2Vec model [5000features_40minwords_10context] </br>
    Random Forest, accuracy: 0.93 </br>
    After calculate the word embedding matrix, can go further by using K-Means so as to divide words into different categories (e.g. animal, divide, weather, etc). Represent each review with combination of categories, then train ML model.
